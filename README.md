# My Personal Portfolio

Built with React and Styled Components, this website shows a bit about me and my experience in the software field.

## My process

### 1. Font + Color

Before writing up any code, I had to choose my color palette and my typography first.  
To help me choose colors, I started off with my favourite color combination - Orange and White.  
I then went on <https://coolors.co/> to generate the rest of the palette for me.  
For font choice, I went on <https://fontjoy.com/> and kept generating fonts till I saw something I liked. I wanted the fonts to look clean, modern and professional.

### 2. Design

To design my website, I used Figma - A free tool to design and prototype websites. I designed each screen one by one, using the fonts and color palette I chose.  
I also used Figma to generate my landing page name SVG (for the animation) and curve SVG.  

To achieve the parallex scrolling effect on the landing page, I downloaded a free wallpaper (from a quick Google search), and used Photoshop to separate each part I wanted
moving with the quick selection tool. I saved each part as a PNG and set different scrolling speeds + directions for each one to achieve a dynamic starting page.

For the illustrations found on each section of the page, I used <https://undraw.co> and searched for illustrations that would correlate with each section. 
As for the icons, I used Font Awesome Icons as I like their icon styles and I know they would have all the icons I needed for this website.

### 3. Coding

I decided not to use a library such as MUI or Semantic UI as I felt like it would limit my creativity/design choices. I used Styled Components to design each component the 
way I wanted and also gave me plenty of css skills. 

I also used [Animate on Scroll](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) to create the slick animations when scrolling down the page.
